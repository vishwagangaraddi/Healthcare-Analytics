# Healthcare Analysis (interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel/Power BI/Tableau)
This project analyses healthcare data in Excel, covering patients, doctors, visits, treatments, and lab results. It delivers dashboards and KPIs on treatment success, costs, patient trends, and doctor performance. Insights help identify high-risk patients, improve care quality, and enhance hospital efficiency.

## Project Objective  
- Analyze healthcare data covering **patients, doctors, visits, treatments, diagnoses, and lab results**.  
- Identify **treatment effectiveness, patient trends, and high-risk groups** to improve decision-making.  
- Build **interactive dashboards** highlighting KPIs such as treatment outcomes, visit trends, costs, and doctor performance.  
- Provide **insights for improving patient care, resource allocation, and operational efficiency**.

## Process  

### 🔹 Data Collection & Preparation  
- Gathered from visits, patients, doctors, treatments, and lab results.  
- Cleaned and standardized fields (dates, diagnosis names, treatment categories, patient demographics).  

### 🔹 Data Modeling  
- Built a **star schema** for analysis.  
- Fact tables: **Visits, Treatments**  
- Dimension tables: **Patients, Doctors, Diagnosis**  

### 🔹 KPI & Dashboard Development  
- Designed metrics for **treatment success rate, average treatment cost, doctor ranking, patient distribution**.  
- Built dashboards with **filters, drilldowns, and cross-tool comparisons**.  

### 🔹 Analysis  
- **Excel Pivot Tables & Charts** – initial exploration and KPI tracking.  
- **Power BI Dashboards** – advanced analytics with interactive reports.  
- **Tableau Dashboards** – rich visual insights and dynamic storytelling.

- **![Tableau Dashboard](https://github.com/vishwagangaraddi/Healthcare-Analytics/blob/main/Tableau-Dashboard.png)**

## Insights  

- **Treatment Effectiveness**: Success vs failure rates identified best-performing treatments.  
- **High-Risk Patients**: Chronic conditions + frequent visits flagged for special care.  
- **Doctor Performance**: Ranked by patient outcomes and treatment effectiveness.  
- **Cost Analysis**: Average cost per treatment outcome revealed cost-effectiveness.  
- **Patient Trends**: Seasonal peaks in visits (Oct & Dec) due to check-ups and vaccinations.
