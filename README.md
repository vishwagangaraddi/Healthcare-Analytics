# Healthcare Analytics (interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel/Power BI/Tableau)
This project analyzes healthcare data in Excel, covering patients, doctors, visits, treatments, and lab results. It delivers dashboards and KPIs on treatment success, costs, patient trends, and doctor performance. Insights help identify high-risk patients, improve care quality, and enhance hospital efficiency.


## Project Objective  
- Analyze healthcare data covering **patients, doctors, visits, treatments, diagnoses, and lab results**.  
- Identify **treatment effectiveness, patient trends, and high-risk groups** to improve decision-making.  
- Build **interactive dashboards** highlighting KPIs such as treatment outcomes, visit trends, costs, and doctor performance.  
- Provide **insights for improving patient care, resource allocation, and operational efficiency**.

## Process  

### Data Collection & Preparation  
- Gathered from visits, patients, doctors, treatments, and lab results.  
- Cleaned and standardized fields (dates, diagnosis names, treatment categories, patient demographics).
- Loaded the dataset into MySQL for preprocessing and structured querying. 

### Data Modeling  
- Built a **star schema** for analysis.  
- Fact tables: **Visits, Treatments**  
- Dimension tables: **Patients, Doctors, Diagnosis**  

### KPI & Dashboard Development  
- Designed metrics for **treatment success rate, average treatment cost, doctor ranking, patient distribution**.  
- Built dashboards with **filters, drilldowns, and cross-tool comparisons**.  

### Analysis  
- **Excel Pivot Tables & Charts** – initial exploration and KPI tracking.  
- **Power BI Dashboards** – advanced analytics with interactive reports.  
- **Tableau Dashboards** – rich visual insights and dynamic storytelling.
